## A simple application to betting football matches (work in progress)

In this project, I'm developing a simple application to predict the results of real-world football matches.
Current version of an app uses only basic data types available in Python.

To enhance the application's functionality, I plan to utilize an SQL database and introduce the following features:

- Allow administrators to effortlessly add upcoming matches for users to predict.
- Enable users to register and submit their predictions through a convenient login interface.
