## A simple application to betting football matches (work in progress)

In this project, I'm planing to develop a simple application to predict the results of real-world football matches.

This application will utilize an SQL database to provide the following functionalities:

- For administrators: Effortlessly add upcoming matches for users to predict.
- For users: Register and submit their predictions through a convenient login interface.

Current version of an app uses only basic data types available in Python.
